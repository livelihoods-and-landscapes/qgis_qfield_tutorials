# QGIS and QField Tutorials

Code to generate online QGIS and [QField](https://qfield.org) tutorials which provide instructions on a workflow for mobile geospatial data collection and management. Plese visit the tutorials [here](https://livelihoods-and-landscapes.github.io/qgis_qfield_tutorials/). The tutorials cover:

**1. Form Creation:** creating a data collection project and form using QGIS.

**2. Mobile GIS data collection:** using [QField](https://qfield.org) mobile GIS app to collect geospatial data on mobile devices.

**3. Complex Forms:** creating complex data collection projects and forms using QGIS including one-to-many relations between tables.

**4. Syncthing:** using [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) to sync data on remote devices with a central computer and manage data collection projects on multiple remote devices.

These tutorials were generated as part of an ACIAR funded project which is developing open source geospatial applications to support climate-sensitive landscape management in Pacific Island Countries. The tutorials were initially developed for a training workshop with the Ministry of Forests, Fiji, and have subsequently been used for various training activities in Fiji and Tonga.
