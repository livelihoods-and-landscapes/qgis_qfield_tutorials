These tutorials instruct on a workflow for collecting, visualising, and analysing spatial data for mapping and monitoring diverse landscapes. 

This workflow is comprised of open-source geospatial applications:

* **In the field:** Use QField mobile GIS to map landscape resource use.
* **In the cloud:** Server apps and databases to sync data collected on mobile devices.
* **On your desktop:** Use map.landscape dashboard to analyse and visualise landscape data collected in-the-field.
* **At scale:** Use satellite images and machine learning to monitor inter-annual landscape dynamics.

## Mobile GIS data collection

This workflow uses QField mobile GIS for mapping diverse landscapes and how landscape resources are used in-the-field. There are three introductory lessons that outline the steps required to setup a QField data collection project followed by tutorials demonstrating how QField has been used by landscape stakeholders in Fiji and Tonga.   

### [Lesson 1](lesson_1.html)

1. QGIS and QField setup 
2. Project creation and form generation

### [Lesson 2](lesson_2.html)

3. Opening projects in QField
4. Data collection using QField
5. Syncing data from mobile devices

### [Lesson 3](lesson_3.html)

6. Generating complex data collection forms

### [Tonga Crop Survey](tonga_crop_survey_1.html)

Slide deck demonstrating how QField can be used for farm and crop surveys.

### [Community mapping](usecase_communitymap.html)

Use QField to map landscape features used to support livelihoods

### [Ground truth data collection](usecase_groundtruth.html)

Use QField to collect ground truth points for validating land cover maps generated from satellite images.

### [Ground Truth - ERPD Pilot](usecase_erpdpilot.html)

Second tutorial, using QField to collect ground truth points for validating land cover maps generated from satellite images.

## Visualise and analyse

### [map.landscape overview](maplandscape_overview.html)

Introduction to map.landscape dashboard for syncing, visualising, and analysing landscape data collected in-the-field.

## Map landscape dynamics

### [Collect Earth Online](lulc_ceo.html)

Use machine learning and satellite images to map inter-annual landscape dynamics.
